# Overview

This is a Next.js-style web application called "Another World is Possible" - a story-driven platform that helps purpose-driven visionaries discover and architect their authentic narratives. The application presents a "metamyth" system that transforms personal and organizational stories into functional tools for regenerative transformation. It features a mystical, fantasy-themed design with immersive visual storytelling, custom atmospheric backgrounds (flame, earth, mountains, forest, campfire), and progressive zoom effects that create an adventure-like journey through the narrative sections.

# Deployment Configuration

## Production Build Process
The application uses a two-step build process for production deployment:
1. **Client Build**: Vite builds the React frontend to `dist/public/`
2. **Server Build**: ESBuild bundles the Express server to `dist/index.js`

## Static File Serving
- **Development**: Vite middleware handles all client requests with hot module reloading
- **Production**: `serveStatic` function serves built files from `dist/public/` directory
- **Implementation**: Environment-based conditional in `server/index.ts` automatically switches between development and production modes

## Deployment Commands
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Run production server
cd dist && NODE_ENV=production node index.js
```

## Deployment Fix (Resolved August 17, 2025)
**Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE** - Fixed production deployment issue where the `serveStatic` function was correctly implemented but required the production server to run from the `dist/` directory to properly locate the built client files.

### Root Cause Analysis
The deployment error "serveStatic function is not defined" was actually a **path resolution issue**, not a missing function. The `serveStatic` function exists in `server/vite.ts` and uses `path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "public")` which resolves to `dist/public/` only when the bundled server runs from the `dist/` directory.

### Complete Solution Package:
1. **Existing Build Process** (already correct):
   ```bash
   npm run build  # Creates dist/index.js + dist/public/
   ```

2. **Production Deployment Scripts**:
   - `start-production.sh` - Validates build and starts server from correct directory
   - `deploy-production.js` - Node.js deployment wrapper with error handling
   - `test-production.js` - Build validation utility

3. **Deployment Documentation**:
   - Created `DEPLOYMENT.md` with comprehensive deployment guide
   - Documented all deployment options and troubleshooting steps

### Validated Deployment Methods:
```bash
# Method 1: Shell script
./start-production.sh

# Method 2: Manual (for Replit deployment)
cd dist && NODE_ENV=production node index.js

# Method 3: Node wrapper
node deploy-production.js
```

### Key Technical Insights:
- `serveStatic` function is correctly implemented in `server/vite.ts`
- Path resolution requires server to run from `dist/` directory  
- Build artifacts are correctly placed in `dist/public/`
- Solution works for both local and Replit deployment environments

### For Replit Deployment:
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `cd dist && NODE_ENV=production node index.js`
- All deployment scripts and documentation are ready for production use
