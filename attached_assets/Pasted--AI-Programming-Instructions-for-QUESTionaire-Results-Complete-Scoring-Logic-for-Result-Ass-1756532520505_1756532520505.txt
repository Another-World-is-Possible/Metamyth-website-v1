# AI Programming Instructions for QUESTionaire Results - Complete

## **Scoring Logic for Result Assignment:**

### **Primary Qualification Criteria:**
**Question 4 (Investment Scale):**
- $1K+ options = Advanced Track eligible
- Under $1K or "exploring scale" = Community Track

**Question 7 (Authority to Act):**
- "I decide for myself and others" = High authority (4 points)
- "I influence major decisions" = Medium-high authority (3 points)  
- "I need to build consensus" = Medium authority (2 points)
- "I'm preparing for authority" = Low authority (1 point)
- "I'm exploring my power" = Minimal authority (1 point)

**Question 6 (Readiness Timeline):**
- "Lightning strikes now" = Immediate (4 points)
- "Thunder rolls within three moons" = Short-term (3 points)
- "Storm clouds gather this cycle" = Medium-term (2 points)
- "Still reading the signs" = Long-term (1 point)

### **Scoring Algorithm:**
```
Advanced Track IF:
- Question 4 >= $1K AND
- Question 7 >= 3 points AND  
- Question 6 >= 3 points

Community Track IF:
- Question 4 < $1K OR
- Question 7 < 3 points OR
- Question 6 < 3 points
```

### **Edge Case Handling:**
- If Question 4 = $1K-5K but authority/readiness scores are low → Community Track
- If Question 4 = "exploring scale" regardless of other scores → Community Track
- If any qualification data is missing → Default to Community Track
