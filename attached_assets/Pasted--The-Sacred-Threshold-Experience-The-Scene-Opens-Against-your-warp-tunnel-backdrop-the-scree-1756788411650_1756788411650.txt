# The Sacred Threshold Experience

**The Scene Opens:**
Against your warp tunnel backdrop, the screen begins completely dark except for a faint, otherworldly glow emanating from the center—like starlight bleeding through cosmic fog.

**The Revelation Begins:**
Ghostly, luminescent text materializes letter by letter in an ancient, mystical typeface. Each character appears with a subtle shimmer, as if being written by an invisible hand with liquid light:

*"You stand at the threshold between stories..."*

The text glows with an ethereal purple-white radiance, then fades to a softer luminescence as the next line begins to appear:

*"Beyond this portal lies the most ancient technology—"*

*"The conscious rewriting of your life's story..."*

*"Only those committed to becoming authors of reality may proceed."*

**The Portal Materializes:**
As the final words settle into their gentle glow, the input field slowly fades into existence—not appearing instantly, but materializing like morning mist taking shape. It pulses with the same ethereal light, a soft breathing rhythm that makes the entire interface feel alive.

**The Sacred Prompt:**
Below the input, final text whispers into being:

*"Speak the word of power to cross the threshold..."*

**The Living Interface:**
The entire portal breathes subtly—expanding and contracting almost imperceptibly, as if the gateway itself is a living entity. The background tunnel swirls gently, particles of light occasionally drifting across the screen like digital fireflies.

**The Moment of Truth:**
When they type, each letter appears with that same ghostly luminescence. Wrong password causes the text to flicker and fade: *"The ancient words elude you..."* 

Correct password triggers the entire portal to pulse with brilliant light before dissolving into their MetaMyth journey.

**The feeling:** Like approaching a sacred temple where each step forward must be earned, where technology becomes magic, and where crossing the threshold genuinely feels like stepping into another world.
