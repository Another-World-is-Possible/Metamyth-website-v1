# **Horizontal Timeline with Scrolling Background - Replit Instructions**

## **Setup the Basic Structure**

Create a horizontal scrolling experience where users scroll through your transformation landscape while horizon descriptions appear at the right moments.

**Step 1: Prepare Your Horizontal Image**
Upload your three-phase transformation panoramic image to Replit. This single wide image should show the journey from wasteland (left) to restoration (middle) to regeneration (right).

**Step 2: Create the Scrolling Background Effect**
Set up your page so the background image moves horizontally as users scroll vertically. The image starts showing the wasteland on the left and progressively reveals the restoration and regeneration phases as you scroll down.

**Step 3: Position the Horizon Content**
Create three content sections that appear at specific scroll points:
- First section appears early in the scroll, describing Horizon 1 (1-3 years)
- Second section appears in the middle of the scroll, describing Horizon 2 (3-7 years)  
- Third section appears at the end of the scroll, describing Horizon 3 (7-20 years)

**Step 4: Coordinate Image and Content**
Align the timing so that:
- When Horizon 1 content appears, the background shows the wasteland/early restoration
- When Horizon 2 content appears, the background shows active restoration work
- When Horizon 3 content appears, the background shows the regenerated biophilic city

**Step 5: Style the Content Overlays**
Make the horizon descriptions appear as semi-transparent cards or overlays that don't interfere with seeing the background transformation image. Use your standard text styling with good contrast.

**Step 6: Test the Flow**
Ensure users can clearly see the visual transformation in the background image as they read about each horizon phase, creating a cohesive journey from current challenges through breakthrough to ultimate vision.

The result is a scrolling experience where the visual transformation supports and enhances the written horizon descriptions.
