World Wise Web - Chaordic Band

‚Å®Brandon‚Å©: I'm interested in how this might be used to address the broken information ecosystem and the sensemaking crisis? I have been working with some people on figuring out a platform that would involve information evaluation, mult-perspectival vetting, participatory local journalism, encourage the organization of local in-person current events discussion groups, and would provide processes for improving the quality of information through processes that would filtering out highly polarized misinformation while still providing alternative viewpoints and avoiding narrow reality tunnels. We want to develop a network that would cover current events and information at all geographic scales, including the national and international, while still having a local connection. Would HIVE have any of these capabilities? Or could it be enhanced to provide this? If you guys perhaps do not yet have all of these elements figured out yet then perhaps my partners could consider enhancements that might offer these additional features?

For your MetaMyth launch structure with conditional payments, here are the cleanest ways to handle the payment processing:

## Option 1: Stripe Pre-Authorization (Recommended)
**What it does:** Temporarily holds funds on their card without actually charging them.

**How it works:**
- User signs up and provides card details
- Stripe creates a "payment intent" or "authorization hold" for $100
- If they complete + share within timeframe: You void the hold (no charge)
- If they don't complete: You capture the held funds

**Pros:** 
- Most user-friendly (no actual charge unless they don't complete)
- Professional appearance
- Easy to void/capture via Stripe dashboard or API

**Setup:** Use Stripe's Payment Intents API with `capture_method: 'manual'`

## Option 2: Immediate Charge + Refund

Today

the arcs cut the context section of each segment, we want the arcs to not just be titles but to be a page setting up each leg of the journey, then each piece, then the artifact -- we want the context to frame each part, then the process of writing helps them to synhtesize the whole artifact 

these should be sections that have no text box, just the button to keep going. leave the artifacts at the end of each section like the calling etc they still work
