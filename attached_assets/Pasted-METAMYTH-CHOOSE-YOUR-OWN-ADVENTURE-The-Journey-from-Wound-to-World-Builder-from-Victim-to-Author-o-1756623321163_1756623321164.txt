METAMYTH: CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE
The Journey from Wound to World-Builder, from Victim to Author of Reality
Enhanced Edition with Synthesis Artifacts

Awaken.
 Adventure is calling. Do you accept?
Our crisis is a completely broken story. A species destroying its only home for numbers on a screen; an economic system that grows by devouring what sustains it; a world that has gone amuck because we've forgotten it's a story in the first place. We've taken it so seriously that we've stopped writing it.
Our purpose has always been to create the world through story—to create ourselves, pass on our connection and history, and have visions of the future that we communicate to others and make real in the telling. We have forgotten this purpose and have blindly consented to be characters in someone else's story, one that none of us truly wrote.
But here's the cosmic joke that'll set you free: We wrote this nightmare, so we can rewrite it.

HOW TO REWRITE YOUR LIFE
What follows is the journey home to yourself, to the purpose-driven world-builder you've always been beneath the stories that were never yours to begin with. This is about rewriting your life story on purpose. For too long, you've been a background extra wandering through scenes that drain your soul and waste your gifts. But you can take charge of that story, make it an epic, and transform into the hero you were always meant to be.
This framework is the master prompt for your organizational and personal DNA. As you fill this out, you are writing the code for your reality. Therefore, there is only one rule:
Be impeccable with your word
Time to remember why you're here.

PREAMBLE: THE ORIGIN STORY
The Foundational Myth That Shapes Everything
Every hero's journey begins before the call to adventure—in the ordinary world that shaped them, the primordial essence from which their quest is born. Like a seed, your origin contains the DNA of the entire story that follows.
QUESTIONS THAT REGENERATE THE FOUNDATION:
What early experiences taught you how the world really works?
 Think beyond happy childhood memories to moments that revealed the deeper patterns—times when you saw through adult pretenses, witnessed injustice, or recognized your own power to affect others.
Who showed you what was possible in a human life?
 Not just heroes and mentors, but anyone whose existence expanded your sense of what you could become—rebels, artists, outcasts, wisdom keepers who lived differently than everyone else.
When did you first realize you were different from other people?
 The moment you recognized you saw things others didn't, cared about things others ignored, or felt called to something that made no practical sense.
What has always felt sacred to you, even when you couldn't explain why?
 The thread that runs through your entire life—the thing you've always protected, served, or been drawn to, regardless of whether it made sense to others.
