# THE METAMYTH SYSTEM
**Organizational Story Transformation**

---

## THE RADICAL PROCESS OF REALITY AUTHORSHIP

We give people back control of their stories. Most organizations operate from scattered narratives written by market forces, investor expectations, and cultural programming rather than their authentic purpose. We connect their deepest mission to a larger planetary story, raising the stakes of what they're doing and connecting people to their highest self while helping them navigate the distance between here and there.

The Metamyth System maps the mythogenetic sequence of the story of our lives—a story that has been written by other people until we take control of it. This is the radical process to take back control of reality itself from the broken story that we are stuck in, enabling us to evolve on purpose toward the vision of the world that we write.

We transform the solo hero's journey into a community quest by inviting others into the story to make it reality. We regenerate their authentic story and integrate it into every aspect of their operations, creating coherent forces of planetary transformation.

## HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS

### **Phase 1: The Metamyth Journey**
*The Foundational Story Regeneration*

A 90-minute intensive session where we guide leadership through five essential movements that regenerate their organization's authentic story. Using structured inquiry, we reveal the narrative that's always been there, waiting to transform how they operate.

**The Five Movements That Reveal Everything:**
- **The Calling**: The crisis that called the organization into existence
- **The Quest**: Their deepest purpose and unique role in planetary transformation
- **The Vision**: The world they're creating when they follow purpose fully
- **The Mission**: Their practical mission plan and pathway forward
- **The Request**: How others discover their role in this larger story

Organizations receive their complete Metamyth distilled into five core statements, plus a comprehensive Story Living Guide showing exactly how to integrate this narrative into operations. We identify what's currently misaligned between their authentic story and how they actually operate. The process creates material for custom AI instructions, allowing their systems to understand and operate from their authentic story.

### **Phase 2: The Story Living Intensive**
*Complete Organizational Alignment*

A multi-day deep dive where we systematically align every aspect of the organization with their regenerated story. This transforms scattered operations into coherent narrative expression.

We work through their complete story system, creating 22 living artifacts that become practical tools for decision-making, communication, and culture creation. Each artifact represents meaningful structure from their journey—their unique symbols, methodologies, values, and frameworks that can be invoked for specific situations.

**Complete Story Integration Includes:**
- Organizational story alignment across messaging, operations, team culture, and community building
- Custom mythology and visual identity that authentically represents their narrative
- Brand strategy, marketing, and regenerative development
- Comprehensive media strategy for authentic storytelling
- Fundraising, offers, and engagement strategies that call in aligned supporters
- Team training to embody and share the story naturally

Organizations emerge with complete coherence between who they are and how they operate. Every communication flows from authentic narrative. Every decision aligns with deepest purpose. Every team member becomes a natural ambassador for the mission.

### **Phase 3: Story Cinema**
*Bringing Stories to Life Through Media*

The media strategy developed in Phase 2 naturally leads to bringing regenerated stories to life through cinematic narrative. Using the story we've revealed and the strategy we've created, we produce compelling visual media that attracts people into the organization's quest.

This comprehensive ecosystem includes fundraising support, community building through authentic storytelling, and complete media implementation across platforms. We use the same movie magic that makes you believe kids can do magic or dinosaurs are real to show the world that another way of operating is not just possible—it's inevitable.

## WHO WE SERVE

Purpose-driven organizations ready to stop playing by someone else's rules and start authoring their own reality. These include conscious entrepreneurs, B-Corp founders, nonprofit leaders, and mission-driven companies who know their work matters but struggle to communicate why in ways that create the response they need.

These leaders have vision and passion but lack the narrative coherence to attract aligned resources, team members, and community. They're tired of competing on features in a race-to-the-bottom economy and ready to start cooperating toward shared missions that help everyone evolve on purpose.

We work with organizations ready to invest in foundational transformation—those who understand that authentic story isn't marketing but the DNA that makes all strategy coherent.

## THE TRANSFORMATION

Organizations that complete the Metamyth System operate with unprecedented clarity and alignment. They step out of market competition and into planetary collaboration. Their messaging writes itself because they know exactly who they are. Teams align naturally around shared narrative. They attract the right people because authentic story calls to those meant to join them.

**The Results:**
- **Strategic Clarity**: The story becomes their foundation, guiding all decisions and eliminating scattered energy
- **Natural Marketing**: Communication becomes authentic expression rather than promotional manipulation
- **Organic Culture**: Team culture develops around shared narrative and purpose
- **Regenerative Operations**: Systems flow from collaborative principles rather than extractive business models
- **Aligned Resources**: They attract investors, partners, and team members who share their vision

The transformation turns work into adventure, customers into communities, and scattered efforts into coordinated planetary healing. Organizations become living examples of what's possible when purpose and operations align completely.

## THE LARGER VISION

**Building the New Operating System: MythOS**

The game of business is broken, based around meaningless metrics that connect to no larger story. Organizations here to change the world are using the same operational systems as the organizations doing the extracting.

We're creating a world that works for all, where work is an adventure, through a new operating system—MythOS—that makes the process of doing meaningful work into the adventure it deserves. This AI-first platform brings stories to life, guides people along their authentic paths, and enables interconnection with compatible stories where we discover that our needs are other people's gifts.

The platform enables planetary coordination around shared challenges by mapping global problems to the collective story inventory. Climate restoration, social healing, and economic transformation become achievable when enough compatible stories federate around shared missions.

Each organization we transform demonstrates what's possible when authentic story guides operations, creating the evidence base for widespread adoption. This is how conscious organizations build the new economy by proving that purpose-driven collaboration consistently outperforms profit-focused competition across every metric that predicts long-term success.

**The Metamyth System isn't just organizational consulting—it's civilizational transformation, one story at a time.**
