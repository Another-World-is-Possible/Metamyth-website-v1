# The QUESTionaire: The Complete Call to Adventure

### **"The 7-Question Journey That Reveals Who's Really Writing Your Life"**
### **"Are You the Hero of Your Story or a Background Character in Someone Else's?"**

*The old story is ending—systems designed for scarcity destroying abundance, narratives built on separation fragmenting communities, economic myths optimized for extraction devouring the living world. But here's what the breakdown reveals: we're living through the greatest transformation in human history. All around the world, people are awakening to their power as reality authors. They've remembered the fundamental truth that reality is made of stories, and whoever controls the narrative controls the future. The fate of our species may depend on how many people remember they hold this power before it's too late. This could be your moment of awakening.*

**The Origin of Your Quest**

### **1. Your Authorship in the Great Story**

**Reality is authored by those who remember they hold the pen. In this great transition between worlds, some people discover they're writing their own story while others remain trapped in scripts they never chose. Where do you stand in claiming authorship of your destiny?**

* [ ] I actively author reality—leading an organization and shaping our narrative and direction  
* [ ] I'm consciously building my story—creating a venture and controlling how it unfolds
* [ ] I have significant influence—helping write the story within a larger organization
* [ ] I'm authoring my voice—developing authentic personal or professional expression
* [ ] I'm awakening as an author—discovering my story while breaking free from others' expectations
* [ ] I feel like a character—stuck performing roles others wrote, desperately wanting to hold the pen

*The first step to transformation is recognizing where you stand. Authors create worlds. Characters simply inhabit them.*

### **3. Your Story Challenges and Dragons**

**Every meaningful quest involves both discovering your unique gifts and facing what blocks your path. Heroes don't avoid dragons—they learn what treasures the dragons guard. What story challenges are you currently navigating? (Select all that apply)**

* [ ] **The Clarity Quest**—I need to understand my unique narrative and contribution clearly
* [ ] **The Message Forge**—I struggle to communicate my value or vision with power and consistency
* [ ] **The Attraction Cipher**—I'm not magnetizing the right people, funding, or opportunities to my cause
* [ ] **The Focus Challenge**—I'm scattered across directions without coherent momentum or storyline
* [ ] **The Community Weaving**—I need to cultivate engaged audiences, stakeholders, or deeper team alignment

### **4. The Scale of Your Quest**

**In the stories that matter most, heroes aren't measured by what they hoard but by what they're willing to risk for transformation. What magnitude of change are you here to author, and what is that story worth to your soul?**

* [ ] **$15K-50K+ annually**—**Planetary transformation**: My story serves global healing and deserves maximum commitment

### **5. Your Wealth Beyond Gold**

**The old story says only those who can pay in money deserve transformation. We're writing a different story—one that recognizes the many forms of wealth that build new worlds. Beyond financial power, what riches do you bring to the fellowship of reality authors?**

* [ ] **Systems alchemy**—I redesign organizational structures and processes that regenerate rather than extract
* [ ] **Technology sorcery**—I build digital platforms and tools that connect consciousness and serve collaboration
* [ ] **Economic wizardry**—I work with money, investment, and resource flows in ways that heal rather than harm

* [ ] **Sacred presence**—I offer consistent energy, attention, and unwavering commitment to what matters most

* [ ] **Lightning strikes now**—I feel electricity in my veins and I'm ready to embark on this quest immediately  
* [ ] **Thunder rolls within three moons**—Something powerful is awakening and I'm actively seeking the right guides
* [ ] **Storm clouds gather this cycle**—I sense the perfect moment approaching and I'm preparing for the journey
