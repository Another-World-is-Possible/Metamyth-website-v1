# The QUESTionaire: Complete Mythic Journey

### **"The 7-Question Journey That Reveals Who's Really Writing Your Life"**
### **"Are You the Hero of Your Story or a Background Character in Someone Else's?"**

*Right now, our civilization is writing its final chapters. Systems designed for scarcity are destroying abundance. Stories built on separation are fragmenting communities. But here's what the breakdown reveals: we're living through the greatest transformation in human history. All around the world, people are awakening to their power as reality authors. They've remembered the fundamental truth: reality is made of stories, and whoever controls the narrative controls the future. The fate of our species may depend on how many people remember they hold this power—before it's too late.*

**The old world is ending. The new one is being written right now. Some people will author the future consciously. Others will simply react to what gets created around them. This journey reveals which one you are—and what becomes possible when you pick up the pen.**

---

### **1.**

**In the middle of civilizational collapse and rebirth, are you writing your own story or just reacting to everyone else's chaos?**

* [ ] I'm actively writing my story—I know what I'm building and why it matters
* [ ] I'm mostly in control of my path but ready to go way deeper into conscious creation
* [ ] I'm breaking free from others' expectations but still discovering what's actually mine to write
* [ ] I feel completely stuck in stories other people wrote and I desperately want out

*Most people discover they're not as much in control as they thought. The awakening can be uncomfortable—and liberating.*

### **2.**

**We're living through the collapse of the old world and the birth of something entirely different. When you imagine stepping fully into who you could become in this emerging reality, what happens in your body?**

* [ ] I feel electric—I can see my role in what's coming and I'm actively moving toward it
* [ ] Something in me wakes up and hungers to explore this possibility deeper
* [ ] I feel it calling but invisible walls keep stopping me from breaking through
* [ ] I'm so buried under everyone else's crises I can barely imagine my own transformation

*Your body knows the truth before your mind does. What it's telling you matters more than you realize.*

### **3.**

**The old economy is dying. But some people are building what comes next. What have you learned or created that could actually serve the world we're trying to birth?**

* [ ] I understand broken systems and I see pathways to rebuild them regeneratively
* [ ] I build with technology but I want to create solutions that heal rather than extract
* [ ] I craft communication that helps people see through the illusions holding us back
* [ ] I naturally gather people around what matters most and watch communities come alive
* [ ] I spot opportunities and solutions that remain invisible to others
* [ ] I create meaningful work but I'm still learning how to make it economically sustainable
* [ ] I've cultivated networks that could connect game-changers for world-shifting collaboration
* [ ] When something genuinely matters, I show up with everything I have

*Every person carries medicine the world desperately needs. Most haven't learned to see their gifts clearly yet.*

### **4.**

**Every person building something meaningful hits the same core challenge that either stops them or becomes rocket fuel. What's the biggest gap between your potential and your current reality—and what happens if nothing changes in the next 12 months?**

* [ ] I'm not clear on my unique contribution and I'm wasting precious time on work that isn't mine—years slip away
* [ ] I keep getting pulled into opportunities that drain me instead of feeding my real mission—burnout is inevitable
* [ ] I'm succeeding at things I don't care about while my soul's work gets no resources—I'm dying inside
* [ ] I know exactly what needs to exist but I can't crack the code on making it financially viable—I might surrender
* [ ] I'm scattered across too many directions and nothing gains real momentum—I'm spinning wheels while the world burns

*The thing that stops most people isn't external circumstances. It's internal clarity. This gap is either your prison or your laboratory.*

### **5.**

**Building the new world requires vision, commitment, and resources. If you found the right strategic alliance to accelerate what you're here to create, what's genuinely realistic for your investment over the next 6-12 months?**

* [ ] $15K-50K+ annually—I command substantial resources and have authority to deploy them strategically
* [ ] $5K-15K—I have meaningful capacity and will invest significantly in authentic transformation
* [ ] $1K-5K—I'm strategic with resources but will commit to the right guidance and community
* [ ] $500-1K—I'm building capacity while investing primarily energy and attention in aligned work
* [ ] Exploring exchange—I need to understand what's possible before knowing what commitment makes sense

*Most people either underestimate or overestimate their real capacity. Accurate assessment is the foundation of effective action.*

---

### **6.**

**The emerging economy runs on collaboration, not extraction. Beyond what you might receive, how do you see yourself contributing to a community of people consciously authoring the future?**

* [ ] Systems innovation—I redesign structures, processes, and agreements that embed new values
* [ ] Technology development—I build platforms, tools, and digital solutions for conscious collaboration
* [ ] Economic transformation—I work with finance, investment, and resource circulation in regenerative ways
* [ ] Creative expression—I use art, design, and media to communicate visions that inspire transformation
* [ ] Community cultivation—I create spaces where authentic connection and mutual support flourish
* [ ] Story amplification—I help articulate and spread narratives that shift consciousness
* [ ] Network weaving—I connect souls and facilitate relationships that create collaborative magic
* [ ] Learning integration—I'm developing capacity to contribute more meaningfully as I grow

*Communities that change the world are built by people who show up to give, not just get. Your contribution style reveals everything.*

### **7.**

**Every transformation has a single point of maximum leverage—the one shift that unlocks everything else. Complete this sentence: "If I could change one thing that would transform my entire trajectory, it would be..."**

**[Open text field with examples:]**
- "Getting crystal clarity on what I'm actually meant to build in this lifetime..."
- "Finding genuine collaborators who share the vision and can help birth it..."
- "Cracking the code on sustainable economics for meaningful work..."
- "Breaking free from others' expectations and fully trusting my authentic path..."
- "Developing the courage to step into the leadership role this work demands..."

*The thing you're most afraid to admit you need is usually the thing that would change everything.*

**This is it. This is the moment. The old stories that built our world are killing it, and the window for conscious intervention is closing. But the breakdown is revealing something extraordinary: ordinary people remembering they are the authors of reality itself. They're not waiting for permission or perfect conditions. They're picking up the pen and writing the future into existence—regenerative economies, collaborative communities, technology that serves life, governance that honors the whole. The transformation isn't coming someday. It's happening now, authored by those who remember their power to imagine new worlds and make them real.**

**Your responses show exactly where you stand in this great authorship. We'll reach out within 48 hours—not with generic next steps, but with resources, community, or collaboration designed for your specific role in writing what comes next. The future isn't waiting for heroes to save it. It's waiting for authors to write it.**

**The pen is in your hand. The page is blank. The story begins now.**
