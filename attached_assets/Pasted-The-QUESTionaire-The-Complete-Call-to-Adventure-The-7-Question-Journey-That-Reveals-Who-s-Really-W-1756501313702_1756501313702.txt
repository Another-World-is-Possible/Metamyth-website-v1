The QUESTionaire: The Complete Call to Adventure
"The 7-Question Journey That Reveals Who's Really Writing Your Life"
"Are You the Hero of Your Story or a Background Character in Someone Else's?"
The old story is ending—systems designed for scarcity destroying abundance, narratives built on separation fragmenting communities, economic myths optimized for extraction devouring the living world. But here's what the breakdown reveals: we're living through the greatest transformation in human history. All around the world, people are awakening to their power as reality authors. They've remembered the fundamental truth that reality is made of stories, and whoever controls the narrative controls the future. The fate of our species may depend on how many people remember they hold this power before it's too late. This could be your moment of awakening.

The Origin of Your Quest Every hero's journey begins with what came before—the experiences that forged you, the struggles that strengthened you, the commitments that shaped you. Tell us your story: What brought you to this moment? What have you already tried to move your life or work forward? What have you invested—time, money, energy, heart—in transformation, growth, or building something meaningful? [Open text field]

1. Your Authorship in the Great Story
Reality is authored by those who remember they hold the pen. In this great transition between worlds, some people discover they're writing their own story while others remain trapped in scripts they never chose. Where do you stand in claiming authorship of your destiny?
* [ ] I actively author reality—leading an organization and shaping our narrative and direction
* [ ] I'm consciously building my story—creating a venture and controlling how it unfolds
* [ ] I have significant influence—helping write the story within a larger organization
* [ ] I'm authoring my voice—developing authentic personal or professional expression
* [ ] I'm awakening as an author—discovering my story while breaking free from others' expectations
* [ ] I feel like a character—stuck performing roles others wrote, desperately wanting to hold the pen
The first step to transformation is recognizing where you stand. Authors create worlds. Characters simply inhabit them.

2. Your Vision of Victory
When your story reaches its triumphant conclusion—when you've authored the reality you came here to create—what victories do you see? What transformations become possible when your authentic narrative is fully expressed? (Select all that resonate)
* [ ] Crystal clarity—I know exactly who I am, what I offer, and why it matters deeply
* [ ] Magnetic attraction—The right people, opportunities, and resources flow to me naturally
* [ ] Thriving community—I'm surrounded by engaged allies who champion the work and each other
* [ ] Purposeful prosperity—My work generates abundant resources while serving what I care about most
* [ ] Authentic influence—My voice shapes conversations and decisions that create positive change
* [ ] Sustainable impact—My efforts compound over time, creating lasting transformation beyond myself
* [ ] Aligned organization—My team or company operates from shared values and unified vision
* [ ] Legacy worth leaving—Future generations inherit a more beautiful world because of my story
Victory isn't just personal success—it's the transformation that ripples out when authentic stories are lived fully.

3. Your Story Challenges and Dragons
Every meaningful quest involves both discovering your unique gifts and facing what blocks your path. Heroes don't avoid dragons—they learn what treasures the dragons guard. What story challenges are you currently navigating? (Select all that apply)
* [ ] Clarity—I need to understand my unique narrative and contribution clearly
* [ ] Message—I struggle to communicate my value or vision with power and consistency
* [ ] Attraction—I'm not magnetizing the right people, funding, or opportunities to my cause
* [ ] Focus—I'm scattered across directions without coherent momentum or storyline
* [ ] Community—I need to cultivate engaged audiences, stakeholders, or deeper team alignment
* [ ] Authenticity—My external success doesn't reflect my internal values or fulfill my soul
* [ ] Vision—I have ideas but struggle turning them into sustainable, scalable reality
* [ ] Alliance—I’m building this story alone when I desperately need aligned collaborators
Dragons aren't obstacles—they're guardians of the exact treasure you need. Your challenges reveal your destiny.

4. The Scale of Your Quest
In the stories that matter most, heroes aren't measured by what they hoard but by what they're willing to risk for transformation. What magnitude of change are you here to author, and what is that story worth to your soul?
* [ ] $15K-50K+ annually—Planetary transformation: My story serves global healing and deserves maximum commitment
* [ ] $5K-15K—Regional influence: My narrative reshapes industries, communities, and countless lives
* [ ] $1K-5K—Personal mastery: I'm investing strategically in becoming who I'm destined to be
* [ ] $500-1K—Apprentice path: I'm building capacity while proving my dedication to the quest
* [ ] Exploring scale—I'm still discovering what magnitude of story my soul is called to tell
The universe provides resources in proportion to the transformation you're brave enough to create.

5. Your Wealth Beyond Gold
The old story says only those who can pay in money deserve transformation. We're writing a different story—one that recognizes the many forms of wealth that build new worlds. Beyond financial power, what riches do you bring to the fellowship of reality authors?
* [ ] Systems—I redesign organizational structures and processes that regenerate rather than extract
* [ ] Technology—I build digital platforms and tools that connect consciousness and serve collaboration
* [ ] Economics—I work with money, investment, and resource flows in ways that heal rather than harm
* [ ] Creative—I use art, media, and storytelling to make impossible realities feel inevitable
* [ ] Community—I create spaces where authentic souls find each other and collective magic happens
* [ ] Narrative—I help articulate and spread stories that shift how people see what's possible
* [ ] Network—I connect the right people and resources at the perfect moments for breakthrough
* [ ] Presence—I offer consistent energy, attention, and unwavering commitment to what matters most  Write in your unique gifts: [custom response box] 
True wealth isn't what you own—it's what you create, connect, and contribute to the healing of our world.

6. Your Moment of Readiness
Every hero's journey reaches the moment when destiny calls and the soul must answer. When you imagine stepping fully into your most authentic story—the vision that makes your heart race with possibility—what happens in your body, and when does that transformation begin?
* [ ] Lightning strikes now—I feel electricity in my veins and I'm ready to embark on this quest immediately
* [ ] Thunder rolls within three moons—Something powerful is awakening and I'm actively seeking the right guides
* [ ] Storm clouds gather this cycle—I sense the perfect moment approaching and I'm preparing for the journey
* [ ] Still reading the signs—I feel the calling but I'm listening carefully for divine timing
The call to adventure doesn't wait for perfect conditions. It comes when your soul is ready to claim its destiny.

7. Your Authority to Act
In the stories that change everything, heroes have the power to make decisions that matter. What authority do you command in writing the next chapters?
* [ ] I decide for myself and others—I can commit resources and make strategic choices autonomously
* [ ] I influence major decisions—My voice carries significant weight in important choices
* [ ] I need to build consensus—I can advocate strongly but require others' agreement for major commitments
* [ ] I'm preparing for authority—I'm developing the capacity to make autonomous decisions
* [ ] I'm exploring my power—I'm discovering what authority I have and how to use it wisely
True power isn't dominion over others—it's the authority to author your authentic story into reality.
