                This is it. We are standing at the threshold of something monumental. The old story that built our world is ending, and the new one is being written by people who remember they are the authors of reality itself. They're not waiting for permission or perfect conditions. They're picking up the pen and writing the future into existence—regenerative economies, collaborative communities, technology that serves life, governance that honors the whole.
              </p>
              <p className="typography-body text-cream-white mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                This could be the moment that changes everything for you. Your responses reveal exactly where you stand in this great authorship—and what specific support could accelerate your role in what's emerging. We'll reach out within 48 hours with resources, community, or strategic alliance opportunities designed for your unique position in the shift.

              <p className="typography-body text-cream-white mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                But understand this: we don't write your story for you—we help you LIVE it. As with all real magic, the more you believe, the realer it becomes. This work requires commitment, courage, and the willingness to step into the unknown. The pen is in your hand. The future is waiting. What story will you write?

                The old story is ending. Systems designed for scarcity are destroying abundance. Stories built on separation are fragmenting communities. But here's what the breakdown reveals: we're living through the greatest transformation in human history. All around the world, people are awakening to their power as reality authors. They've remembered the fundamental truth: reality is made of stories, and whoever controls the narrative controls the future. The fate of our species may depend on how many people remember they hold this power—before it's too late.
