                The old story is ending—systems designed for scarcity destroying abundance, narratives built on separation fragmenting communities, economic myths optimized for extraction devouring the living world. But here's what the breakdown reveals: we're living through the greatest transformation in human history. All around the world, people are awakening to their power as reality authors. They've remembered the fundamental truth that reality is made of stories, and whoever controls the narrative controls the future.

                    Every great story reaches the moment when the hero glimpses their ultimate destiny—the legacy they're called to create, the change they're meant to author into reality.

What legacy did your authentic story create? What became possible because you remembered you were the author?
